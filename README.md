# Illumination-Simulation

# Steps to build:
1. Open opengl.sln
2. Right click on the project name, then go to Properties. 
3. In the Properties Pane, go to "Debugging", and in this pane there is a line for "Command-line arguments". Add the name of the ".json" file you would like to test on this line. (All ".json" files are stored in the path of “src\scenes”, from c. json to o.json, which are to describe the different geometries used for testing this project.)
4. Run the program by clicking "Start" button.
